+ FRONTEND

REACT (SINGLE PAGE APPLICATION)


Before start:

+ the database used was a simple SQLite file called "db.sqlite3" you can find
it on the root backend folder (you can see the structure with dbeaver or any GUI of your choice)

+ It has just one user, the user management system is planned to the version 2 ok?
but you can use the admin interface with the admin user, follow the credentials:

user: admin
password: admin

+ on the main page menu you can find the link to access the login page and
after logging in, the menu will be changed to show the reserved area

+ let me know if you need any help, please



INSTALL AND RUN THE BACKEND API

1 - INSTALL DEPENDENCIES

run the following command in the backend root folder

$ pip install -r requirements.txt


2 - RUN THE LOCAL SERVER


If you just want to run locally and test your frontend just in your own machine:

$ python manage.py runserver

it will run the server on this address:

http://localhost:8000 (generally, it will show for you the right host and port)

If you would like to see in other devices or machines in your network

$ python manage.py 0.0.0.0:9090 (you can choose any port that you want, to avoid conflicts for example)

note this address because you will need it to config the backend address on the frontend .env file


INSTALL AND RUN THE FRONTEND API

1 INSTALL DEPENDENCIES 

run the following command in the frontend root folder

$ npm install

now you need to change the backend address on the .env (frontend root folder) file:

REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL="http://localhost:9090" this is the default value, but

if you want to run the front end in other devices in your network  you need to change it
to the new address generated on step 2 of the backend setup.

to run the frontend server you just need to run the following command:

$ npm start

it will show you the frontend address.

this app was made with the mobile-first approach, so, you should test it on a smartphone to see how it is

Thank you!
